# Snarl_bootstrap

This is a remix of my recipe website from the last project.

The website is built with the Bootstrap 4 framework, using the twelve column and row grid.

The website features a working landing page and a 'submit your own recipe' page (senda.html). It has a header with a logo and 
a working navbar that changes the links color on hover and displays a different color on the active page. It also features a
form on the senda.html page, however it's not working as it requires .php knowledge. The page is fully responsive as per 
bootstrap.

I liked working with bootstrap. Its certainly easier than writing everything with flexbox in the .css, and I liked how easy it
was to add/overwrite bootstraps features in my own .css. I found ready-made code online for navbars, footers and whatnot and 
added it to the page with minor hiccups. I removed those before returning this project though. I also found out that theres 
visual Bootstrap website builder apps. I haven't tried one yet but I imagine it could save some time with building the skeleton
of a page and then going into the code for details.
